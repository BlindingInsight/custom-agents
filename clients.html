    <h1>Who We Work With</h1>
    <p>If you have real pain and want real software — we’re your people.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>Our Ideal Partners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Executives or business leaders with urgent, high-impact problems</li>
      <li>Operators who have tried vendors, consultants, or internal teams without success</li>
      <li>Decision-makers ready to experiment fast and co-build with us</li>
      <li>Teams that want to own the outcome — not outsource the problem</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You Won’t Get</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No decks. No buzzwords. No frameworks for frameworks.</li>
      <li>No off-the-shelf products. No generic chatbots. No “labs.”</li>
      <li>No seven-figure retainers. Just a working prototype, fast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You Might Be a Fit If...</h2>
    <p>You are the owner of a small business or a VP, SVP, or CxO in Operations, Technology, Strategy, or Transformation. You're frustrated by slow internal teams or unclear vendor roadmaps. You have something urgent you wish “someone would just build already.” You have a clear vision for what's costing you time and want to automate it.</p>

    <h2>Who We're Not For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you only want a strategy deck to convince your board</li>
      <li>If your team’s just experimenting with AI for fun</li>
      <li>If success means a press release, not a working solution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We like working with people who are impatient to ship — and tired of hearing no.</p>
