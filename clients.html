    <h1>Who We Work With</h1>
    <p>If you have real pain and want real software — we’re your people.</p>
    <p>No decision committees.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>Our Ideal Partners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Executives or business leaders with urgent, high-impact problems</li>
      <li>Operators who have tried vendors, consultants, or internal teams without success</li>
      <li>Private Equity or rollup funds that want to integrate portfolio companies and make them efficient</li>
      <li>Decision-makers ready to experiment fast and co-build with us</li>
      <li>Teams that want to own the outcome — not outsource the problem</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You Won’t Get</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No decks. No buzzwords. No frameworks for frameworks.</li>
      <li>No off-the-shelf products. No generic chatbots. No “labs.”</li>
      <li>No seven-figure retainers. Just a working prototype, fast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You Might Be a Fit If...</h2>
    <p>You are the owner operator of a small business or a VP, SVP, or CxO in Operations, Technology, Strategy, or Transformation, or a Private equity / rollup firm that wants to create efficiency in your portfolio companies. You're frustrated by slow internal teams or unclear vendor roadmaps. You have something urgent you wish “someone would just build already.” You have a clear vision for what's costing you time and want to automate it.</p>

    <h2>Who We're Not For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you only want a strategy deck to convince your board</li>
      <li>If your team’s just experimenting with AI for fun</li>
      <li>If success means a press release, not a working solution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We like working with people who are impatient to ship — and tired of hearing no.</p>
