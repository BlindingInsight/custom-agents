    <h1>Start Now</h1>
    <p>No obligation. No sales pitch. Just working software.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>Our Zero-Risk Offer</h2>
    <p>You bring the problem. We co-design and co-build a working proof-of-concept with you in an iterative manner. No obligation to continue. No contract until you’ve seen something real. We want to work with teams who value action, not just intention.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Intro Call:</strong> You share your biggest pain point. We listen, challenge, and clarify.</li>
      <li><strong>Rapid Design:</strong> In a few days, we sketch an architecture and map dependencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-Build:</strong> We build the first working version together — real workflows, real outputs.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision Time:</strong> You decide if we continue. No pressure. No lock-in.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why We Do It This Way</h2>
    <p>Because enterprise AI isn’t a sales cycle. It’s a partnership. Our best work comes when both sides roll up their sleeves and build. And frankly, we only want to work with people who are ready to ship.</p>
