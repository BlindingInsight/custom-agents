    <h1>Why Custom AI</h1>
    <p>End to end solutions.</p>
    <p>Your business is unique and you have a differentiated strategy. Is your technology unique to you? Don’t build another disconnected tool. Build your decision architecture. Build the digital brain of your business customized to exactly how your business runs.</p>

    <h2>Point Solutions vs. Platforms</h2>
    <p>Most AI efforts fail because they start with isolated use cases and never scale beyond the organizational silos in which it was created. We believe that the future belongs to platforms — modular, extensible systems that amplify how your enterprise makes decisions across functions and domains.</p>

    <h2>Build your own platform</h2>
    <p>Don't send the core details of your business operations to the cloud to train someone else's models. Control your data. Control your workflows. Control your applications. Create the software brain that adapts to your business strategy - not the other way around, where your business has to work around the generic solutions offered by vendors looking to create platform lock-ins.</p>
    
    <h2>The $2 to $10 Strategy</h2>
    <p>We start small — call it a $2 scoped use case. But we design it to scale to a $10 platform. Core to our approach is the idea that the small use cases get connected to each other through a common digital brain. That means you get real ROI fast without painting yourself into a corner. Each proof-of-concept contributes to a broader, integrated foundation for enterprise decision-making.</p>

    <h2>Natural Language as the New Interface</h2>
    <p>AI platforms shift the interface from tools to conversations. Your employees interact directly with knowledge: summarizing RFPs, generating strategy briefs, analyzing supply chain issues — all via natural language. No dashboards, no reports. Just answers.</p>

    <h2>Agentic Workflows and Feedback Loops</h2>
    <p>We don't just build one-off GPT wrappers. We engineer full agentic systems with memory, iteration, and purpose. Humans stay in the loop, and feedback becomes fuel. Over time, your platform learns, evolves, and drives continuous improvement.</p>

    <h2>Business-Aligned Design</h2>
    <p>Our platforms mirror your business, not your org chart. We co-design workflows that match how your people think, decide, and act. This ensures better decisions, faster adoption, and a stronger competitive edge.</p>

    <h2>Increase the ROI of AI</h2>
    <p>Stop paying for back and forth tokens with Large Language Models. Switch from a principle of prompting to training a swarm of small models, running on pay-as-you-go hardware, rather than API based token pricing.</p>
