    <h1>Why AI Platforms</h1>
    <p>Don’t build another disconnected tool. Build your decision architecture.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Point Solutions vs. Platforms</h2>
    <p>Most AI efforts fail because they start with isolated use cases and never scale. We believe that the future belongs to platforms — modular, extensible systems that amplify how your enterprise makes decisions across functions and domains.</p>

    <h2>The $2 to $10 Strategy</h2>
    <p>We start small — a $2 scoped use case. But we design it to scale to a $10 platform. That means you get real ROI fast without painting yourself into a corner. Each proof-of-concept contributes to a broader, integrated foundation for enterprise decision-making.</p>

    <h2>Natural Language as the New Interface</h2>
    <p>AI platforms shift the interface from tools to conversations. Your employees interact directly with knowledge: summarizing RFPs, generating strategy briefs, analyzing supply chain issues — all via natural language. No dashboards, no reports. Just answers.</p>

    <h2>Agentic Workflows and Feedback Loops</h2>
    <p>We don't just build one-off GPT wrappers. We engineer full agentic systems with memory, iteration, and purpose. Humans stay in the loop, and feedback becomes fuel. Over time, your platform learns, evolves, and drives continuous improvement.</p>

    <h2>Business-Aligned Design</h2>
    <p>Our platforms mirror your business, not your org chart. We co-design workflows that match how your people think, decide, and act. This ensures better decisions, faster adoption, and a stronger competitive edge.</p>
